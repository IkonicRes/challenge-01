# Horiseon Digital Marketing
## A simple page to browse Horiseon's digital marketing services.

This page is a resource for those who would like to learn more about search engine optimization, online reputation management, and how to market with social media. 
I built this page to teach people a bit more about digital marketing, and increasing visibility and traffic for their website. Anyone looking for further information about these subjects and how they can utilize them in their own website can find some of that information here. I learned a lot about css structure, good conventions and how to use flex to its potential.

## Usage
Here is the link to the site for your browsing pleasure: [Horiseon Digital Website](https://ikonicres.github.io/horiseon-digital-website/)  
The navigation bar on the top right contains navigation links that will jump to each corresponding section when clicked. The layout should be responsive and scale to fit smaller screens like phones, tablets, and laptops, but should also scale well to fit 4k, 1080p, and 720p television sets. A preview of the page is shown below.

## Credits

I was working on this with Quentin, Akon, and a couple other students in the study group. But mostly by myself in a cold dark corner. I used FireAlpaca to merge the two screenshots of the page into one for the readme. Much thanks to FlexZombies and w3schools.

## Features

This page should scale correctly to any width or height, and therefore should work on any device, be it tablet, smartphone or TV. It has nav-links at the top so you can jump to the different content sections, and an easy to look at neat layout with even spacing.
